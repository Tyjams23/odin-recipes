    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This is a delicious, basic French toast recipe made with eggs, milk, and bread. Serve this popular breakfast dish with butter and maple syrup. Round out a delicious savory and sweet brunch menu with bacon or sausage. Fruit or berries are delicious alternatives, too.</p>
      <p>French toast is very easy: Soak thick slices of bread in an egg and milk batter, then fry them to crisp up the outside and cook the egg custard center. It cooks fast and is a great way to use up stale bread. This recipe uses just a few basic ingredients you likely have in the kitchen already, and it freezes incredibly well, so it's economical too.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>4 Large Eggs</li>
        <li>1 Cup Milk</li>
        <li>1 Tsp sugar, optional</li>
        <li>1 Dash Salt</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Butter, for the pan</li>
        <li>8-10 Slices Bread, preferably stale or day old</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients</li>
        <li>Break the eggs into a wide, shallow bowl and beat them lightly with a fork or whisk</li>
        <li>Stir the milk, sugar, and salt into the beaten eggs</li>
        <li>Coat a skillet with a thin layer of butter. Place it over medium low heat</li>
        <li>Place the bread slices, one at a time, into the bowl or plate. Let the bread soak up the egg mixture for a few seconds and then carefully turn to coat the other side. Coat only as many slices as you will be cooking at one time to prevent soggy French toast. </li>
        <li>Transfer the egg-coated bread slices to the hot skillet or griddle. Heat slowly until the bottom is golden brown. Turn and brown the other side.</li>
        <li>Serve French toast hot with butter and syrup, or your preferred toppings. Enjoy.</li>
      </ol>
